# HyCharts - A Python Wrapper for HighCharts #

*HyCharts* is a Python wrapper for [HighCharts][http://www.highcharts.com] designed to display interactive plots inside of the [IPython Notebook][http://www.ipython.org/notebook.html] environment. *HyCharts* is [*numpy*][http://www.numpy.org] and [*pandas*][http://pandas.pydata.org] aware, which bridges the gap between data munging and interactive visualization. *HyCharts* objects are as close as possible to the `JSON` representation outlined in the [HighCharts API][http://api.highcharts.com] which makes serialization and storage of charts easy, for instance with [MongoDB][http://www.mongodb.org].
